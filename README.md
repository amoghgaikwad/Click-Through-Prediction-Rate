Task 1: Preprocessing the Data 
 


Task 2: Training the Data 
Code : “CodeFiles/Training_GD_SGD.py”
The code for the model, training both SGD and GD are given in this
file, one of them is commented.
This file was run twice, once for getting the run time for GD and once
for getting the run time of SGD.
The model for SGD is commented in the file.

Output: “Ouput/Graph_SGD_GD.png”


Task 3: SGD Metrics 

Computing Accuracy, FPR, AU-ROC
Output: “Ouput/Ouput_SGD_Metrics”
Accuracy = 0.831453634085
FPR = 0
Area under ROC = 0.530511565624 


Task 4: L2 Regularization method 

Test Data Metrics on Best model:
Accuracy = 0.831453634085
FPR = 0
Area under ROC = 0.513972036317
